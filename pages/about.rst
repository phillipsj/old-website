Hi,

My name is Jamie Phillips and this is my site to share anything and everything.  I will try to focus my efforts on spatial technology and software development.  I have been working in the GIS field since I graduated.  I enjoy participating in open source software and social coding projects.  I hope you find what I have to share of some value.
